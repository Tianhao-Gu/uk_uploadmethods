parameters :
    staging_file_subdir_path :
        ui-name : |
            GenBank File Path
        short-hint : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.
        long-hint  : |
            File with genome sequence in GenBank format or zip-file with GenBank files.

    genome_name :
        ui-name : |
            Genome Object Name
        short-hint : |
            Provide a name for the Genome that will be created by this importer
        long-hint  : |
            Provide a name for the Genome that will be created by this importer

    genome_type:
        ui-name : |
            Genome Type
        short-hint : |
            The type or source of this genome
        long-hint  : |
            The type or source of this genome

    source :
        ui-name : |
            Source of the GenBank File
        short-hint : |
            Identify the source of the GenBank File.
        long-hint : |
            Identify the source of the GenBank File. (If Ensembl, the "gene" feature types will use the "gene" field as the ID; otherwise the "locus_tag" field is used.)

    release :
        ui-name : |
            Release or Version of the Source Data
        short-hint : |
            Release or version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)
        long-hint : |
            Release or version of the source data (for example: Release31, V4)

    genetic_code :
        ui-name : |
            Genetic Code for the Organism
        short-hint : |
            Valid genetic code (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)
        long-hint : |
            Valid genetic code integer for translation purposes (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi)

    scientific_name :
        ui-name : Scientific Name
        short-hint : Provide the scientific name of the species
        long-hint  : Provide the scientific name of the species, e.g., "Escherichia coli". This is important for taxonomy lookup.

    taxon_id:
        ui-name: Taxonomy ID
        short-hint: Will try to link the Genome to the specified taxonomy id
        long-hint: If defined, will try to link the Genome to the specified taxonomy id in lieu of performing the lookup during upload

    generate_ids_if_needed :
        ui-name : |
            Generate Feature IDs if Needed
        short-hint : |
            Generate feature IDs if the fields normally used are not present
        long-hint : |
            Generate feature IDs if the fields normally used are not present. 
            For gene features the locus_tag field is used (unless the source is Ensembl; then the gene field is used).
            For CDS features the protein_id field is used.
            Autogenerated IDs will have the format "gene_1" or "CDS_3"

    generate_missing_genes :
        ui-name : |
            Spoof Genes for parentless CDS
        short-hint : |
            Generate gene feature for CDSs that do not have a parent in file
        long-hint : |
            Some files may contain only codeing sequences but KBase genomes are
            expected to contain a parent gene for these CDS. This option
            generates spoof genes based on the CDS location.
