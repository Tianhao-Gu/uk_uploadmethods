    <p>This App allows users to load FASTQ format paired-end read libraries directly into the workspace from sources on the web. In addition to standard HTTP and anonymous FTP links, the user may also obtain files from Google drive and Dropbox links. Please see the <a href="http://kbase.us/data-upload-download-guide/short-reads//">FASTQ/SRA Reads Data Upload/Download Guide</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>If your reads are in a publicly accessible URL, you can directly import the reads into your Narrative using either this App, the <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_uploadmethods/load_single_end_reads_from_URL/release”>Import Single-End Reads from Web</a> App, or <a href=”https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/apps/kb_uploadmethods/import_sra_as_reads_from_web/release”>Import SRA File as Reads from Web</a>the App.</p>

    <p><u>How to Use a ‘Google Drive Public Shared Link’</u><br>In the source location in Google Drive:
      <ol>
        <li>Left click on the file and select ‘Get shareable link.’</li>
        <li>Make sure the file setting is set to ‘Anyone with the link can view.’ Otherwise go to ‘Sharing settings.’</li>
        <li>Copy the public file sharing link.</li>
        <li>Paste the link into the “SRA URL” entry field.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><u>How to use a ‘Dropbox Public Shared Link’</u>
      <ol>
        <li>Click on ‘Share’ on the file.</li>
        <li>Make sure the file setting is set to ‘Anyone with the link can view this file.’ Otherwise go to ‘Link settings.’</li>
        <li>Click on the ‘Copy link’ button.</li>
        <li>Paste the link into the “SRA URL” entry field.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>As the files are loaded, the new objects appear in the data pane at the top left.</p>
